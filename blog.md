## Algorithmic Trading Strategies

I wrote these trading strategies in college to better understand the concepts I was learning in my math and stats classes. They are ordered roughly by how effective they were. 

1) [PCA Mean Reversion](https://rishubnahar.com/blogCategories/pca_Mean_Reversion.html)
      - Trading strategy that identifies optimal mean reverting portfolios based off of principal component analysis.

2) [ML for Utility Stocks](https://rishubnahar.com/blogCategories/utilityML.html)
      - Created strategy to predict buy or sell signals for utility companies in the S&P 500 with logistic regressions

3) [Bayesian Network Shorting](https://github.com/Rishub21/Stock_Bayesian_Network)
      - Constructs a bayesian network from any given portfolio to determine the best times to short stocks.
